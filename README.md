# feOxy
A bare bones web browser.

Currently only a rendering engine.

Not meant to be feature complete, more of a learning tool/exercise.

In order to run:
* install rust `$ rustc --version` to check installation
* install cargo `$ cargo --version` to check installation
* clone the project `$ git clone https://github.com/kradical/feOxy`
* navigate to the project root `$ cd feOxy`
* run with cargo `$ cargo run`

Currently a default html and css file are hardcoded but it's in the works to have an "address bar" to open different files, and support links instead of a hardcoded css filenames.


An initial color test (wahoo inline-blocks):
